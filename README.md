# iterator-generator-Closure-Decorator
In itertor we use iter() function to create an iterator. If we check its type it will show the Class iterator. 
Iterator is memory efficient

Generator is basically a function along with a keyword yield 
Generator is also one kind of iterator just its object type is generator and as its an object we need to iterate it to access the elements
Generator helps to write a fast and compact codes

Closure is nothing but function will be passed as an argument in other fuctions. This is nothing but function inside a function

Decorator is also next part of a closure in decorator we we have main function and inside it we have sub function. In sub function we can use arguments passed into the main function, arguments can be variables or functions(built in or user defined) decorators mostly uses @ symbol to call the main function
